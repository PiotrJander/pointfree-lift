# Pointfree Lift

This project contains three modules: `onions`, `pointfree`, and `scurses`. Of these, only `pointfree` contains actual work,
`onions` and `scurses` are dependencies.

Within the `pointfree` module, there are two packages: `pointfree` and `lambda`. `pointfree` contains the work discusses in the
project; `lambda` contains the abandoned attempt to add lambda abstraction to the language.
